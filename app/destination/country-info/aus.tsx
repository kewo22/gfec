            Canterbury Institute of Management (CIM) encourages the involvement
            of students in its decision-making and strategic planning on
            student-related matters, through student representation on
            committees and advisory groups. Canterbury Institute of Management
            Student Association (CIMSA) is the official student representative
            body that supports student advocacy and sovereignty.
            <br />
            <br />
            At CIMSA, we recognize that personal wellbeing is important for
            students to progress academically with a positive approach to their
            education and campus experience. We are committed to ensuring that
            all students are supported to have a positive student experience
            whilst studying at CIM. It is our aim to bring all students closer
            together and offers a supporting network for them. If students are
            feeling that they need support at any time, or if a personal problem
            arises that affects their studies at CIM, CIMSA could arranged to
            offer individualized advice. CIM Office Bearers represent CIM’s
            student body of diverse range of cultures and age.
            <br />
            <br />
            CIMSA’s role is vital because it ensures the line of communication
            between CIM governing bodies and its student body. CIMSA Office
            Bearers ensure that student views are considered when decisions are
            made about academic matters and other key areas of the student
            experience at CIM. This process gives CIM students the forum to
            voice their views and gives CIM governing bodies valuable feedback
            from the people who matter the most – our students. CIM is
            continually striving to improve the experience of its students.
            CIMSA Office Bearers will be at the forefront of communicating the
            opinions of the student body.
